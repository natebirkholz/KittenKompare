# KittenKompare

1. Changed `Data` to `ModelData` to not shadow (NS)Data, just as a best practice.
2. Changed `Cat` to a Class to allow self mutation in a closure. Would in pratice discuss this with tech director/lead/architect to determine if the data needed to be value type, but wanted the images working at least.
